**generative music**

<aside class="notes"><p>I make generative music. I have started out with Max/MSP and worked with it for years but at some point I wanted to go deeper and use different environments and languages. In this workshop I will try to give you some background on why I think the browser is an important enivornment for art and how it fits into a broader context of media theory and art history in some sense.</p>

## Live Eternal

**Generative Black Metal in the Web Browser**

<aside class="notes"><p>Maybe some of you have already seen this, its in Brandons spreadsheet. This is my master thesis project live eternal, a generative black metal piece in the browser.  I will sometimes reference this project and how I incorporated some of these thoughts into my art.
In the second half we will look at some code examples on how we can use certain programming concepts or patterns as means of composition. So, lets hit the ground running!</p>

## Part I
**MEDIUM - MESSAGE**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
>The medium is the message.

Marshall McLuhan, 1964

<aside class="notes"><p>This is probably the most infamous quote of modern media theory. It sums up quite well what media theory is all about. McLuhan doesn&#39;t mean that the medium is the whole message, but I let McLuhan explain it himself:</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

<iframe style="width:80vw; height:80vh" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoCrx0scCkM?start=151" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<aside class="notes"><p>Go to 7:56 for question about question content doesn&#39;t matter</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The medium **shapes** the message.

<aside class="notes"><p>So what McLuhan essentially means is that the medium shapes the message and has influence beyond the content of the message. If we believe this to be true this to be true then we have to draw two conclusions about that as artists.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
1. The medium through which we express our art matters.

<aside class="notes"><p>I think we can all agree with that, a simple example a vinyl record is different from a digital streams because the medium not only leaves traces through its material but also the medium allows to be consumed in different ways. A vinyl record often listened to linearly and at length, a digital stream gives the listener more control, so he might skip tracks or listen to them in a different order.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
2. If certain media allows us to express things that others don’t, then we can also create new forms of art through new media/technologies.

<aside class="notes"><p>This is quite obvious of course, electronic music can only exist because we have devices capable of producing electronic sounds. But what it means for us that maybe the browser as a technology offers us a way to create new music. What might be not obvious is what makes the browser as a medium so special and what exactly does it offer?</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
This is what **media art** tries to explore.

<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/nam-june-paik-tape.jpeg" style="background-color: black !important;" -->

**Random Access Music**

<aside class="notes"><p>Paik looks at what it really is that makes tape produce sound. Its a playback head moving over a magnetic tape, the fact that we use to go in just one direction at one specific speed is just a convention. We can do it, and it offers a lot, but  we can also choose not do it and instead explore all possibilities of the medium. If we want to look at how to approach the browser, we should look at its medium-message relationship first.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
![Medium-Message-Relationship](assets/medium-message.svg)

<aside class="notes"><p>We can see here three layers: the browser, which is an environment to execute code, which is what produces sound. What this means is that our sound will always be a direct consequence of code, which is why I will talk primarily about this relationship today. Not because the browser is not interesting, but because the layers that the browser adds to our artwork are of political or social nature, not directly compositional, and we need this compositional foundation of what it means to express art in code.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
What separates **code** from any other medium?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The possibility to **generate** art.

<aside class="notes"><p>This is not unique for the browser, code doesn&#39;t need to run in the browser! However we will see why the browser still plays an important role for art in general. In addition, the browser runs on javascript and that in terms will influence how we write code!</p>

## Part II
**A NEW AGE**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction**

<aside class="notes"><p>In the famous essay TWAITAOMR, Walter Benjamin talks about the transformation that art undergoes as it enters this new paradigm of mechanical reproduction.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
>Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
>[…] One might subsume the eliminated element in the term “aura” and go on to say: that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art.

Walter Benjamin, 1935

<aside class="notes"><p>So in this new age art looses its aura. But Benjamin is by no means mourning the loss of the aura. The aura is an expression of distance, authority and authenticity of an artwork. In the age of manual reproduction, the reproduction is essentially a forgery and has no authenticity, because authenticity is outside of the sphere of manual or technical reproduction. Aura seems to be only possible through authenticity.</p>

**AUTHENTICITY + DISTANCE = AUTHORITY**

<aside class="notes"><p>But Benjamin is by no means mourning the loss of the aura. The aura is an expression of distance, authority and authenticity of an artwork. In the age of manual reproduction, the reproduction is essentially a forgery and has no authenticity, because authenticity is outside of the sphere of manual or technical reproduction. Distance, no matter how near the work of art is, is also an expression of aura. Since the traditional art work is a unique existence in time and space, this distance also exists in both dimensions. Think about standing in front of the Mona Lisa, no matter how close you can get, you can never touch it and even if you could, would you feel like touching its aura? Also the art is fixed in space, and you have to go there and “meet” it, this establishes also a form of hierarchy. The mechanically reproduced artwork however “meets the beholder half way”. The traditional art work is also determined by the history to which it is a subject in the time of its existence. This can too create a distance in time between the art and its beholder.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<!-- .slide: data-background="./assets/camera.jpg" style="background-color: black;" -->

**MASS CULTURE**

<aside class="notes"><p>What happens through this possibility of reproduction is essentially that for the first time in history mass culture becomes possible. That is <strong>THE</strong> change. Art is no longer for a few elites, it becomes available to the people. If we take a closer look to what Benjamin writes in the preface of his essay, we can see why this is so important to him:</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
> When Marx undertook his critique of the capitalistic mode of production ... [he] showed what could be expected of capitalism in the future. The result was that one could expect it not only to exploit the proletariat with increasing intensity, but ultimately to create conditions which would make it possible to abolish capitalism itself.

<aside class="notes"><p>So this process for Benjamin is of huge societal importance in the sense that it is part of a process in which capitalism destroys itself. And of course mass culture becoming available through capitalistic means of production, has had an enormous influence on the way we not only consume but make art.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Why are we talking about this?**

<aside class="notes"><p>Some of you might ask yourself that. If think we are now in another change of paradigm and it can be helpful to look at history to draw our own conclusions for the present.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**The Work Of Art In The Age Of Digital Generation**

<aside class="notes"><p>I would argue that we are in the age of - not only the digital reproduction - but the digital generation of art, and while of course, digital reproduction was an important and interesting step, we now reach an age that is conceptually different than anything we had until now. There is a fundamental difference between reproduction and generation.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
How do we conceptualize **generative music**?

<aside class="notes"><p>The idea of an abstract piece of art which exists only through its specific instantiation, which is unique in time and space. This way of thinking isn&#39;t necessarily new, it has been around in art for quite some time. Not in the dodecaphonic music of Schönberg and his followers, not in the serialism of Messiaen or the algorithmic composition of König or Xenakis. We these ideas in early performance art, for example the sound-walks of Max Neuhaus: The composition exists in the form of a route which the composer knows and walks with his audience. Within that route the sounds are certainly predictable, but ultimately - from a compositional perspective - random. A big topic in performance art is acutally reproduction: some argue that performance can only be “reproduced” in a way that it loses its uniqueness. By means of preservation - a recording, a film - or by means of reenactment - essentially theater. Through both these methods it is essentially no longer performance art.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Why draw the line here and now?

<aside class="notes"><p>Generative music up until now exists almost exclusively in an exhibition space. This means I have the go to the museum, sit on an uncomfortable chair or bench and listen to the generative piece for about 10 minutes with people walking in and out only conceptually being able to grasp the extent of the composition, then going home, mostly disappointed. What good is an endless composition if I can only listen to it one time? This bothered me so much - that i could not listen to generative music in the way i prefer to listen music - that i made live-eternal. so maybe now you start seeing where i&#39;m going at.</p>

>For the first time ever, the devices people use to listen to music are also capable of executing Generative Music systems.

Alex Bainter

<aside class="notes"><p>This quote by artist and developer (behind generative.fm) Alex Bainter explains what has changed: for the first time generative art has the possibility move into mass culture. It has that possibility because we don&#39;t just have the devices but with the modern browser, we now have an environment which allows artists to produce and distribute (important) real-time generative systems quite easily. I say quite easily in contrast to what we would need to do if we wouldn&#39;t a browser. And looking at generative music apps like brian enos, they won&#39;t be mass culture anytime soon.</p>

**authenticity? distance? authority?**

<aside class="notes"><p>We might ask yourself how does this affect those three concepts which benjamin introduces? I cannot give the answers to that but I can give some insight into what it means in my work.</p>

**black metal & authenticity**

        Your browser does not support the
        <code>audio</code> element.
</audio>

<aside class="notes"><p>Black metal is essentially a quest to bring authenticity to the reproducible medium. It does so by means of production: Because of our common understanding of the medium they use (e.g. tape, in the early days) we intuitively know that the recording “has not been tampered with” - meaning what we hear is in fact a physical effort and not some kind of technological trickery. Why is this necessary though? Performance art faces similar issues but often just refrains from reproduction? The answer is twofold. First, from a pragmatic point of view, musicians expressed themselves through the only medium they thought was available to them. Second, black metal is characterized by a misanthropic worldview, an antisocial attitude and individualism above all else (although rather superficial), ideas which do not fit well into the - by nature - social context of a concert/performance. Given the fact that many bands refrain from playing live shows, the authenticity which they can achieve within reproducible media seems - at least to their perception - to be a meaningful one. Black metal is also very anti-technological because from their perspective modern technology is what diminishes authenticity (sounds familiar?). Within the framework of black metal this is certainly true to some extent: By using triggered drum sets and modern production or editing technology the physical effort is no longer present as part of our shared understanding of the medium, but vanishes because of exactly that. This is where generative music comes into play, because our shared understanding of (digital) generative music is not one that is concerned with technological trickery as a substitute for physical effort. There is no physical effort involved which could be harmed in its authenticity by technological forces, authenticity is outside the sphere of digital generation (sounds familiar again?). We can see how our perception of authenticity shifted and how those same questions arise again.</p>

## Part III
**Generative Music & Authority**

<aside class="notes"><p>One last thing i would like to discuss is the relationship between generative music and authority. For this I will introduce a new line of thinking:</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
> To write a poem after Ausschwitz is barbaric.

Theodor W. Adorno, 1949

<aside class="notes"><p>This is a very strong quote that has been discussed extensively, applied to music, misinterpreted and ultimately even kind of retracted by Adorno. We are not going to discuss whether Adorno or not. I bring this up because I think it is almost impossible to talk about western - or more specifically european - modern art without the context of the second world war. I want to clarify that this is a very eurocentric view that I&#39;m discussing here and I don&#39;t want to give anyone the feeling that we can only look at art through this specific lense, its just where I see <strong>myself</strong> as an artist and how I have been educated. What this quote essentially expresses is a feeling of distrust in art. The term art interpreted as the romantic artwork with all its pathos and overwhelmingness, which has been abused by the nazis for propaganda and manipulation.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**art / power**

<aside class="notes"><p>If we agree that art can be used to manipulate emotions - this is done all the time, commericals? movies? - and we have seen where it can lead to - for example fascism, then we have a serious problem as artists. Power creates authority to use Benjamins terminology. If we as artists have power over the listeners emotions -  this power can be abused by ourselves or others, like the nazis used Beethoven. This has led to more and more abstract art, as a means to cede this power. And this could be it, we could be fine with that? Does anyone here know Pierre Schaeffer?</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
>You have to remind musicians of what Dante wrote over the Gates of Hell: Abandon hope all ye who enter here. If you enter, if you want to make music, you must abandon hope. There's no way out of traditional music. 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
>Seeing that no one knew what to do anymore with DoReMi, maybe we had to look outside that. Unfortunately it took me forty years to conclude that nothing is possible outside DoReMi. In other words, I wasted my life.

Pierre Schaeffer

<aside class="notes"><p>This is of course a statement of opinion - but its an opinion that I can intuitively understand. You don&#39;t have to agree with Schaeffer here, but it struck a nerve with me and to be honest I can&#39;t fully express why. Maybe because I have been to conditioned to like traditional music? Maybe it is exciting to explore hierarchy, harmony, tonality and modality in music. Maybe refraining from doing so is like speaking a language that no one else speaks. I honestly can&#39;t give you an answer. But you can see the fundamental dilemma if you were to accept both of these thoughts - Adornos and Schaeffers. The only way out I found as an artist is generative music. The answer for me at least was generative music. With generative music I can move in and out of <em>DoReMi</em> as a merely incidental side effect, I can abstract the patterns behind manipulative music and reveal them as the result of a simple set of rules and not profound, overwhelming, human emotion. Generative music can be a way to give up power and authority. And to come back to why we are all here, the browser can also play a role in that:</p>
